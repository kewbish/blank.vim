= Installation *blank-install* =
Put the below line in your vimrc in the usual place [Vim-Plug version, adapt for whatever plugin manager you use.]

Plug 'kewbish/blank.vim'

Alternatively, you can extract and place the files in the appropriate places.

= Usage *blank-usage* =
blank.vim has three callable commands:
- `:BlankLint`, which creates a new copy of your file under `[name]-blank-diff.[extension]`, and sed-replaces all the quirks out. This results in very broken grammar, due to the fact that it doesn't 'intelligently' remove things. If you choose to use this, you might want to double and triple check your piece before submission.
- `:BlankDiff` runs BlankLint, and opens your files in diff mode, so you can see exactly what's changed. Probably useful to avoid obvious words missing.
- `:BlankHi` highlights all the quirks found in a reddish underline [doesn't run on default] so you can fix as you write.
